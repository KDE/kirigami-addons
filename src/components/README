## timezones.json

This file is taken from https://github.com/evansiroky/timezone-boundary-builder/releases; the 'timezones.geojson.zip' file is chosen as it maps directly to the system available system timezones on Linux. The file is simplified using mapshaper (https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper) to keep it under ~400kb.

The script "timezone_geojson_update.py" automates the download and compress process so that it can be run before any release or upon a timezone change.
