Kirigami-addons is:

A set of "widgets" i.e visual end user components along with a code to support them.

Components should are to be usable by both touch and desktop experiences providing a native experience on both.

Looking native with any QQC2 style (qqc2-desktop-theme, Material or Plasma)

Kirigami-addons can depend on other KF5 frameworks, but things must still work on Android

Components are grouped according to some topic, e.g. 'dateandtime' or 'chat'.
Each group has its own source directory and QML import name. The name follows the scheme of
'org.kde.kirigamiaddons.topic', e.g. 'org.kde.kirigamiaddons.dateandtime'.

Components can use platform specializations, e.g. native dialogs, but a generic implementation for all platforms has to exist.

Kirigami-addons is not:
 - a place for exposing non-visual QML bindings
 - a place for QML bindings for other libraries
 - a place for API for a specific platform

-----

All user exposed QML items should have an example application in the tests folder.
