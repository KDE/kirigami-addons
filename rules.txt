Kirigami-addons is:

A set of "widgets" i.e visual end user components along with a code to support them.

Components should are to be usable by both touch and desktop experiences providing a native experience on both.

Looking native with any QQC2 style (qqc2-desktop-theme, Material or Plasma)

Kirigami-addons can depend on other KF5 frameworks, but things must still work on Android

Kirigami-addons is not:
 - a place for exposing non-visual QML bindings
 - the place for QML bindings for other libraries


-----

All user exposed QML items should have an example application in the tests folder.
